## Summary of an Article from `The Guardian` about Climate

## Change

The article talks about worrying signs of circulation of `Atlantic Ocean`. This circulation of `Atlantic Ocean` is known as *Atlantic meridional overturning circulation* shortly for `Amoc`. This circulation surrounds part of the `Gulf` stream to north of `Arctic Ocean`. This circulation carries cold low-salinity deep water to south and from south the water is being carried to north and also it carries heat, carbon and nutrients from the equator towards *Arctic circle*. This motion of the water helps to distribute energy around the Earth and modulates the impact of human-caused global heating.

However, in recent past the `Amoc` is in abrupt shift. Some specialists are saying this shift never happened in 10,000 years. And this shift is very concerning for mankind. Specifically, in the north glaciers are being eroded because of that fresh water are mixed in the north water making it less saltier and the water that is being carried through is not able to do its job as it supposed to creating a major shift in the circulations output.

Some researchers are saying the major change would happen between 2025 and 2095. On the other hand, the *UK Met Office* said rapid change would not occur in 21st century.  On the contrary, researchers from `Science Advance`has simulated a scenario with data of 2000 years what they found out was very worrisome. They said if it(tipping point) were to happen the whole planets climate will change like wet and dry season of Amazon will reverse, Europe will see less rainfall, the ocean level rise by 1 meter and so. And they emphasize if it happens the changes are irreversible on human timescales.
