  *  `Campaign Visit` this term refers to a unique promotional event where specific offers are made available for a **limited duration**. For instance, consider the scenario of the **flu** season.

* **Agreed Doctor**
  
  *  Our system has two types of doctors:
    
    1. **Contractual Doctors (Agreed Doctors):** These are doctors who have a contract with us. They might earn less from each individual patient compared to other doctors, but they see a higher volume of patients. This not only increases their overall earnings but also their reputation, as they often receive positive reviews from the many patients they see.
    
    2. **Registered Doctors:** These are doctors who have simply registered on our platform. They don’t have a contract with us and may earn more from each individual patient compared to Contractual Doctors. However, they might not see as many patients and therefore might not have as many opportunities to boost their reputation through patient reviews.

* **Payroll Instant Virtual**
  
  *   In our system, we have a third category of doctors known as `Payroll Instant Virtual` doctors. These doctors provide virtual services to patients, meaning they consult and treat patients online, perhaps through video calls or chat.
    
    When a patient makes a payment for these virtual services, the doctors don't receive any portion of this payment. The whole money goes to the system.
  
  * `Payroll Schedule Virtual` does not refer to anything special. it just means the patients can talk to the doctors on specific time that they have set previously.

* **DocTime Points**
  
  *  `DocTime Points` is a rewards system in our platform. Patients can use these points to book appointments with doctors.
    
    Here’s how you can earn `DocTime Points`:
    
    1. **Referrals:** When you recommend our application to your friends and family, and they sign up or use our services, both of you earn points.
    
    2. **Purchasing Medicines:** Sometimes, you can also earn points when you buy medicines through our system.
